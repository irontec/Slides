* Namespace isolation


note:
    Nampespace isolation: 
        groups of processes are separated such that they cannot "see" resources in other groups. For example, a PID namespace provides a separate enumeration of process identifiers within each namespace. Also available are mount, UTS, network and SysV IPC namespaces.
